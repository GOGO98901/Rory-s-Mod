The auto renamer is a machine that will automatically items that have been placed inside.

# Usage

Items can be placed inside by automation (hoppers, pipes, etc.) and also extracted by automation. There is no configuration of inputs and outputs.

The machine also requires power to run and stores `4000RF`. For every rename it will extract `40RF` + the length of the new name.

For example

```
name = "Rory's Mod"
name.length = 10
powerUsage = 40RF + 10RF
```
